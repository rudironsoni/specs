# specs

Specs is a fast, deterministic ecosystem for defining and generating production-ready component specifications across platforms. Available as a Figma plugin and a command-line interface, Specs produces compact, schema-valid specs — sidestepping the cost and errors of agentic Figma extraction.

## Get started

### Plugin

- Visualize specs on-canvas in incomparable detail
- Copy and paste compact spec data into LLMs
- Customize output for styling and layout
- Configure advanced data settings in the UI

[Open the plugin →](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1549454283615386215/specs-2-formerly-anova)

### CLI

- Quickly initialize an environment and fetch data
- Generate 50 component specs in a minute
- Set up for continuous integration
- Configure the files, formats, and data you need

[Set up the CLI →](https://www.specsplugin.com/cli/getting-started/)

Both the plugin and CLI generate specs consistent with the [Specs schema](https://www.specsplugin.com/schema/), a specifications model architected to unify component definitions for implementation across web, iOS, Android, and Figma.

## Repeatable, production-grade specs in seconds

Evaluating and differencing Figma styles and layers across variants is mechanical and predictable — and with Specs, incredibly fast and efficient.

> Update Figma → Generate specs → Agents refine → Update component

The result is a spec that's compact yet complete — not noisy like Figma's REST API data — and built on a schema that agents and engineers can extend. Leave inference about behavior, accessibility, motion, and nuanced customization downstream, where AI agents excel.

|  | Specs ecosystem | Agentic Figma extraction |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | ~1 sec (CLI) / ~10 sec (Plugin) per component | ~5–10 minutes per component |
| **AI cost** | Scripted — 0 AI tokens per component | 25/50/100,000+ AI tokens per component |
| **Consistency** | Deterministic and repeatable | Inference errors, gaps, and overconfidence |
| **Output** | Schema-valid YAML/MD, ideal for testing and versioning | Unstructured Markdown that complicates repeatable verification |
| **Platforms** | Tuned for cross-platform output and configurable Figma intents | Interprets and infers intents |

## Packages

### `@rudironsoni/specs-cli`

Command-line interface (CLI) for generating component specifications from Figma design files.

```sh
# 1. Install cli globally to run with the command `specs`
npm install -g @rudironsoni/specs-cli
# 2. Initialize a specs.config.yaml file
specs init
# 3. Edit the config for your Figma file key and preferred settings 
# 4. Set up an .env file with a Figma PAT
# 5. Fetch raw Figma data (file, variables, styles)
specs fetch
# 6. Scan the file to discover components and build a manifest
specs scan
# 7. Select components in the manifest to be generated
# 8. Generate specs from the manifest
specs generate
```

- [Configuration file](https://www.specsplugin.com/cli/configuration/) details
- Per [command](https://www.specsplugin.com/cli/commands/) instructions and flags


### `@rudironsoni/specs-schema`

The shared type system and JSON schema that defines the structure of UI component specifications is a dependency of `specs-cli` and installed when you install the command line interface as above. However, it is also available as a standalone package.

```sh
npm install @rudironsoni/specs-schema
```

Exports include:

- [JSON Schema](packages/schema/schema/root.schema.json) — the canonical schema for component spec output
- [TypeScript types](packages/schema/types/) — complete type definitions for all schema entities (`Component`, `Config`, `Styles`, `Element`, `AnyProp`, etc.)
- `DEFAULT_CONFIG` — a runtime configuration object controlling output shape (format, token resolution, variant depth, etc.)

Learn more in the [Schema docs](https://www.specsplugin.com/schema/), including details on each property including component, variants, styles, props and more.

### `@rudironsoni/specs-from-figma`

The `specs-from-figma` package is the engine that converts Figma assets into specs. It lives in `packages/from-figma` and the CLI depends on it as a workspace package.

## Architectural Decision Records

Schema changes are proposed and tracked through ADRs in the [`adr/`](adr/) directory. Each ADR documents the context, options considered, and decision for a type or schema modification.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Clone the repo, run `npm install` at the root, and use `npm run build` and `npm test` to validate changes. All packages use Vitest with globals enabled.

### Agents

This repo includes Claude Code agent skills for the full ADR lifecycle:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/specs.adr.create` | Draft a new ADR, claim the next number, and reserve it in the index |
| `/specs.adr.implement` | Apply the type and schema changes described in an ADR to types, schema, tests, and changelog |
| `/specs.adr.accept` | Validate the implementation is clean, mark the ADR as ACCEPTED, and update the index |
