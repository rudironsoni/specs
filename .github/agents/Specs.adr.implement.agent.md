$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root. Parse `REPO_ROOT`, `BRANCH`. All paths must be absolute.
   - Derive `ADR_NAME` from `BRANCH`:
     - The branch name must match an ADR name pattern (e.g., `009-color-values` — starts with a number sequence followed by a hyphen). If it does not, halt: "You must be on an ADR branch (format: `###-short-description`) to implement an ADR."
   - Derive `RELEASE_BRANCH`:
     - Run `git branch -a | grep 'release/'` from `$REPO_ROOT`. Use the local/remote branch name matching `release/*` as `RELEASE_BRANCH`. If multiple release branches are found, halt and ask the author which to target. If no release branch is found, halt: "No release branch found — create one with `/start-next-release` before implementing an ADR." Do NOT derive the release branch from `package.json` — the version in package.json may not match the branch name (e.g. the branch may be `release/schema-0.25.0-cli-0.21.0` while `package.json` still shows the previous version).

2. **Load context**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read `$REPO_ROOT/adr/$ADR_NAME.md` — source of truth for what changes and why
   - **REQUIRED**: Read `src/schema/CONSTITUTION.md` — all six gates must pass
   - Read every `types/*.ts` file named in the ADR Decision section
   - Read every `schema/*.json` file named in the ADR Decision section
   - Read `package.json` for the current version
   - Read `CHANGELOG.md` for the existing format

3. **Verify ADR completeness**: The ADR must have a clear Decision section (type and schema changes listed) and a Semver Decision with `CURRENT → NEW`. If either is missing or marked NEEDS CLARIFICATION, halt and ask the author to complete the ADR first.

4. **Constitution gate check**: Evaluate all six gates against the ADR's stated changes. If any gate fails without a documented exception in the ADR, halt and report the violation before touching any file.

5. **Apply type changes**: For each type file listed in the ADR Decision:
   - Edit the file directly — add, remove, or rename the fields as described
   - Additive changes only for MINOR; structural changes require MAJOR
   - Add JSDoc comments for every new exported type member
   - Preserve all existing exports and comments not mentioned in the ADR

6. **Apply schema changes**: For each schema file listed in the ADR Decision:
   - Edit the file directly — add, remove, or update the property definitions as described
   - New optional field → add to `"properties"` only; leave `"required"` array unchanged
   - New required field → add to both `"properties"` and `"required"` (MAJOR bump)
   - Add `"description"` for every new schema property
   - Validate JSON syntax before saving (malformed JSON must not be written)

7. **Gate 4 — TypeScript compilation**:
   - Run: `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit`
   - If exit code ≠ 0: display errors, revert the files changed in steps 5–6, and halt. Report the specific errors for the author to resolve in the ADR before re-running.

8. **Gate — JSON Schema validation**:
   - Run: `scripts/validate-schema.sh`
   - If any schema fails: revert steps 5–6 changes and halt. Report which file failed and why.

9. **Write or update tests**:
   - Tests live in `tests/` at the repo root (create directory if absent)
   - For a pure types package, tests are TypeScript compilation assertions: files that import the changed types and confirm the expected shape compiles correctly
   - Create or update `tests/[type-name].test-d.ts` for each changed type using `tsd`-style assertions or `@ts-expect-error` patterns
   - Run: `tsc --noEmit --strict tests/*.test-d.ts` to confirm test files compile
   - If tests fail: halt and report
   - **All gates have now passed. Steps 10–12 are REQUIRED before reporting completion. Do not skip to step 13.**

10. **Update docs**:
    - Docs live in `site/src/content/docs/`. Schema type pages are under `site/src/content/docs/schema/` (e.g., `schema/styles.md` for `Styles`, `schema/config.md` for `Config`). Individual config option pages are under `site/src/content/docs/config/` (e.g., `config/tokens.md`, `config/keys.md`).
    - For each property added, removed, or renamed in the ADR: update the relevant doc page's Properties table, Values table, and "Relating properties to values" section to reflect the new state.
    - For new dedicated types (e.g., `LayoutMode`, `WrapAlignment`, `ItemSpacing`): add a row to the Values table describing the type and its valid values.
    - For new config options: check if an individual config option page should be created under `config/` following the pattern of existing pages (e.g., `config/tokens.md`, `config/keys.md`).
    - Do not create new doc pages for types that are only used as field values on an existing documented type — document them inline in the parent type's page.
    - If no doc file exists for the changed type, skip this step.

11. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
    - The release branch scaffolds an `## [X.Y.Z] - Unreleased` heading with empty sections. Add entries into the existing scaffold — do **not** replace `Unreleased` with a date (the date is set at release time). If no scaffold heading exists, prepend one using `Unreleased` as the date.
    - **Format**: one top-level bullet per user-visible change; no sub-bullets; no bold; no code blocks; no wrapping prose paragraphs
    - **Entry line**: `` `Parent.field` `` — one-phrase description; aim for ≤ 12 words; omit implementation detail (class names, file paths, method names)
    - **Names**: `<Parent>.<field>` in backticks, em dash separator — e.g. `Styles.cornerSmoothing` — corner smoothing factor (0–1)
    - **Consolidation**: When a new type exists only to serve a property, merge into one property-first bullet — e.g. `` `Styles.mainAxisAlignment` — typed as `MainAxisAlignment` (`'START' | 'END' | 'CENTER' | 'SPACE_BETWEEN'`) or `null`; description ``. Do not list the type as a separate bullet.
    - **Sections**: use `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Removed` as needed; add `### Migration` (MAJOR or rename only)
    - **Migration line**: `` `Parent.old` → `Parent.new` ``: one sentence; imperative; describe what to read instead and how to handle the new type
    - **Gate**: After writing, verify the new entry is present in the file. If CHANGELOG.md does not contain the new version heading, halt and report — do not proceed to step 12.

12. **Bump version in `package.json`**: Apply the `NEW` version from the ADR's Semver Decision.
    - **Gate**: After writing, read `package.json` back and confirm the `"version"` field matches the ADR's `NEW` version. If it does not match, halt and report — do not proceed to step 13.

13. **Report**: List every file modified (with one-line description each). The list **must** include `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` — if either is absent from the list, halt: steps 11–12 were not completed. State that the author should review the diff and accept the ADR once satisfied. Remind the author that this ADR branch (`$BRANCH`) targets the release branch (`$RELEASE_BRANCH`), not `main`.

## Key rules

- Apply changes directly — do not produce a description document.
- Halt and revert on any gate failure. Do not partially apply a change set.
- Never modify type or schema files not listed in the ADR Decision section. Doc files (`docs/schema/`) corresponding to changed types are always in scope.
- If the actual change required is a higher semver bump than the ADR states, halt and report before touching any file.
- Use absolute paths for all file operations.
