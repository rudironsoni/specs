 * slot fills alongside the primary content for authoring convenience; entries
 * are reachable by a deeper JSON Pointer (e.g.
 * `"#/compositions/filterResultsPage/slotContent/pageHeader"`).
 *
 * A `SlotContentRef` pointing at a `Composition` entry resolves to its
 * top-level triplet. A pointer into `slotContent/<key>` resolves to that
 * `SlotContent` directly. Both yield `anatomy + elements + layout`.
