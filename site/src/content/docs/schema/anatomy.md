The `Anatomy` is a map of named elements that make up a component's structure. Each entry describes what kind of element it is and, optionally, where it was detected and what component it is an instance of.

```ts
type Anatomy = Record<string, AnatomyElement>;
```

## AnatomyElement

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | `ElementType \| ElementTypeRef` | Yes | What kind of element this is |
| `detectedIn` | `string` | No | Frame or node name where this element was found |
| `instanceOf` | `string \| SubcomponentRef` | No | Component name this element is an instance of, or a `$ref` to a subcomponent |

### ElementType

One of 11 string literals:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text` | Text content |
| `glyph` | Icon or symbol |
| `vector` | Vector shape |
| `container` | Layout container (frame, group) |
| `slot` | Insertion point for child content |
| `instance` | Component instance |
| `line` | Line element |
| `ellipse` | Ellipse/circle |
| `rectangle` | Rectangle |
| `polygon` | Polygon |
| `star` | Star shape |

### ElementTypeRef

A URI reference to an externally defined element type:

```ts
type ElementTypeRef = { $ref: string };
// e.g. { $ref: "foundations#/definitions/glyph" }
```

### SubcomponentRef

A JSON Pointer linking to a subcomponent defined in the same spec:

```ts
type SubcomponentRef = { $ref: string };
// e.g. { $ref: "#/subcomponents/formLabel" }
```

Within variants, each element's runtime properties (children, styles, content) are described by the [`Element`](/schema/elements/) type. The element tree can also be expressed as a recursive [`Layout`](/schema/layout/).
